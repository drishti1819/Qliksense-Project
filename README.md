# Retail Sales Dashboard
I have recently created a Retail Sales Dashboard for analysing sales data by states, city, year and country with interactive visualization in Qliksense. The motive of creating this dashboard is to get a rough idea about how many orders have been placed by the customers and by how many states these orders are being placed. 
This dashboard consists of multiple KPI's like Current Year Month To Date of Order Amount, Year To Date of Order Amount, Previous Year of order amount and so on, with some filters. 
In dashboard, to display organised variations and trends different type of charts have been used that shows, number of reward member we have and don't have, information about orders by city where we can look at the highest and lowest orders are in which city and the information by the state. Finally, a table to show top 5 transactions of the state.
This dashboard will help to get the insights of sales and also get an idea of how to improve and where to improve.

The dataset in file Retail Transactions.csv contains Order data of company placed in different state and city along with the order amount, discount amount and transaction date.

Expected Deliverables: Design a sales dashbaord that analyses the Order placed by the company to different region on MTD, YTD and Previous year basis. A filter was required based on State, so that users can select a category and see the trend.
